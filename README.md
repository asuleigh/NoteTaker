ABSTRACT: This is a simple weather Note Taker app that can take the user's input and save it to a dabatase for rendering or deleting in a useful list. The frontend of the app was provided by the Full-Stack Coding program at UNCC Continuing Education. My goal was to create a backend for this app and hook it to the frontend.
